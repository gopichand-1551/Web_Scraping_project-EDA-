🎯 Project Overview:
Extracted, cleaned, and analyzed cricket player rankings data from Cricbuzz using Python, transforming raw web data into actionable insights across Test, ODI, and T20 formats for both men's and women's cricket.
🔧 Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:
🕸 Data Extraction & Web Scraping:
✅ HTTP requests and API handling (requests library)
✅ HTML parsing and DOM navigation (BeautifulSoup)
✅ CSS selector optimization for targeted data extraction
🧹 Data Engineering & Cleaning:
✅ Data transformation and normalization (pandas)
✅ Missing value handling and data type conversions
✅ Multi-source data integration and merging strategies
📈 Statistical Analysis & Insights:
✅ Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis
✅ Cross-tabulation and pivot table analysis
✅ Hypothesis testing (t-tests for statistical significance)
✅ Correlation analysis and pattern identification
📊 Data Visualization:
✅ Interactive dashboards with matplotlib/seaborn
✅ Multi-chart storytelling (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
✅ KDE plots for distribution analysis
🎯 Key Findings:
📌 Analyzed 300+ player rankings across 3 formats
📌 Identified top-performing teams and rating distributions
📌 Discovered gender-based performance patterns
📌 Created correlation insights between player positions and ratings
💡 Business Impact:
This project demonstrates my ability to transform unstructured web data into structured insights - a critical skill for data-driven decision making in any industry.
